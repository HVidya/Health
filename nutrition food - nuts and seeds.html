<div class="nutitious nuts and seeds">

<p>Nuts and seeds are super healthy and an important addition to any health-conscious diet plan. They taste great and make a satisfying snack for both children and adults.</p>

<p>They are good for your overall health as they contain protein, fiber, B vitamins, vitamin E and many other minerals and antioxidants.</p>

<p>In addition, they contain a high amount of monounsaturated fats, the same fats found in olive oil. Monounsaturated fats are heart-healthy. Some of them are also great sources of omega-3 fatty acids.</p>

<p>Eating nuts and seeds regularly plays a key role in managing high cholesterol, high blood pressure, digestive disorders, heart disease, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, arthritis, osteoporosis, Alzheimer’s and dementia.</p>

<p>It’s easy to include nuts and seeds in your diet. Be sure to eat them raw to derive the nutritional value. When exposed to heat during cooking, most of the nutritional qualities are destroyed. You can eat them as is out of the jar or can, or enjoy them soaked, ground or mashed.</p>

<p>However, as most nuts are high in calories and fats, do not eat them in excess. You can incorporate small amounts of a combination of these nuts and seeds in your diet to enjoy their health benefits.</p>

<h3>Here are the top  healthy nuts and seeds you should eat every day.</h3>
<div class="content-block">
<h3>1. Almonds</h3>
<div class="image-content">
 <img src="images/Almonds.jpg" alt="">
 </div>
 <div class="para">    
<p>Though many people consider almonds to be nuts, they are technically the seeds of the almond tree. They are off-white in color, covered by a thin brownish skin and encased in a hard shell.</p>

<p>Both sweet and bitter almonds are readily available in the market. Usually, sweet almonds are edible, while bitter almonds are used to make almond oil.</p>

<p>These oval-shaped nuts contain fiber, protein, calcium, zinc, magnesium, potassium, phosphorus, copper, iron and some B vitamins.</p>

<p>They are also high in many antioxidants, such as vitamin E and selenium. In addition, they are an excellent source of healthy monounsaturated fats.</p>

<p>Regular consumption of almonds can help lower cholesterol, improve cardiovascular health, boost brain power, prevent birth defects, fight constipation, strengthen bones and reduce the risk of Type 2 diabetes. Almonds are also beneficial for your hair and skin.</p>
<p>A small handful of almonds are all you need to eat daily. You can eat the nuts in raw or roasted form, or you can add them as ingredients in salads, smoothies, soups and other dishes. You can even try almond flour, almond milk and almond butter</p>
<p>One serving (28 grams or a small handful) contains roughly:</p>
<ul>
<li>Calories: 161</li>
<li>Total fat: 14 grams</li>

</div>
<h3>11. Peanuts</h3>
<div class="image-content">
 <img src="images/Peanuts.jpg" alt="">
 </div>
  <div class="para">
<p>Peanuts are not technically a nut — they're legumes. However, they are often considered to be nuts and have similar nutrient profiles and health benefits.</p>

<p>One ounce of dry-roasted peanuts contains roughly:</p>
<ul>
Calories: 176
Total Fat: 17 grams
Protein: 4 grams
Carbs: 5 grams
Fiber: 3 grams
Vitamin E: 21% of the RDI
Magnesium: 11% of the RDI
</ul>
<p>A study including over 120,000 people found that higher peanut intake was associated with lower death rates.</p>

<p>Peanuts may also improve risk factors for heart disease.</p>

<p>Interestingly, one study found that there were lower rates of type 2 diabetes in women who ate peanut butter more than five times a week.</p>

<p>However, many peanut butters contain large amounts of added oils and other ingredients. Therefore, it is best to choose peanut butter with the highest peanut content.</p>

<p>Similarly, peanuts are usually salted or flavored, which may eliminate their associated health benefits. Instead, try to choose plain, unsalted, unflavored peanuts.</p>

<p>Furthermore, asthma and allergic disease rates may even be lower in children of mothers who ate peanuts once or more per week during pregnancy.</p>
</div>

<p>BOTTOM LINE:
Peanuts are legumes, not nuts. However, they have nutrient profiles that are similar to nuts and may also help reduce risk factors for heart disease and diabetes.</p>

<h3>12. Hazelnuts</h3>
<div class="image-content">
 <img src="images/Hazelnuts.jpg" alt="">
 </div>
  <div class="para">
<p>Hazelnuts are a great source of manganese and copper as well as many other essential micronutrients. One ounce of hazelnuts contains approximately:</p>
<ul>
<li>176 calories</li>
4.7 grams carbohydrates</li>

<p>Another study published in the Journal of Nutrition found that eating a diet rich in macadamia nuts helped reduce both total and bad LDL cholesterol in 25 adults with high cholesterol.</p>
</div>
<h3>14. Valencia Peanuts</h3>
<div class="image-content">
 <img src="images/Valencia Peanuts.jpg" alt="">
 </div>
  <div class="para">
<p>Peanuts are one of the most common nuts that might pop to mind first, but are peanuts healthy? Peanuts are a good source of many essential vitamins and minerals and can be a healthy dietary addition. One ounce of dry-roasted peanuts contains approximately:</p>
<ul>
<li>164 calories</li>
<li>6 grams carbohydrates</li>
<li>6.6 grams protein</li>
<li>13.9 grams fat</li>
<li>2.2 grams dietary fiber</li>

<li>40.6 micrograms folate (10 percent DV)</li>
<li>1.9 miligrams vitamin E (10 percent DV)</li>
<li>100 miligrams phosphorus (10 percent DV)</li>
</ul>
<p>So why are peanuts good for you? One massive study made up of 83,818 women showed that a higher consumption of nuts and peanut butter reduced the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. (23) Another study found that eating more peanuts decreased several risk factors of heart disease, such as triglyceride levels.</p>

<p>The benefits of eating peanuts may even begin before birth. One study found that eating peanuts at least once per week during pregnancy decreased the risk of allergic disease in children.</p>

<p>Mold is a common concern with peanuts as they are grown underground in moisture. Valencia peanuts are a peanut variety grown in dryer climates, making them less prone to the growth of dangerous mold.</p>
</div>
<h3>15. Pecans</h3>
<div class="image-content">
 <img src="images/pecans.jpg" alt="">
 </div>
 <div class="para">
<p>Pecans are another type of nut notorious for their cardiovascular benefits. They are a rich source of manganese as well as several other key vitamins and minerals. One ounce of pecans contains approximately:</p>
<ul>
<li>195 calories</li>
<li>4 grams carbohydrates</li>
<li>2.6 grams protein</li>
<li>20.3 grams fat</li>
<li>2.7 grams dietary fiber</li>
<li>1.3 miligrams manganese (64 percent DV)</li>

<li>0.2 miligram thiamine (12 percent DV)</li>
<li>1.3 miligrams zinc (9 percent DV)</li>
<li>34.2 miligrams magnesium (9 percent DV)</li>
</ul>
<p>Eating pecans may help reduce several risk factors of heart disease, including decreasing cholesterol levels. A study published in the Journal of the American Dietetic Association showed that pecans could help lower LDL cholesterol levels, even in people with normal cholesterol.</p>

<p>Eating pecans may also boost antioxidant status to neutralize free radicals and fight off chronic disease. One study found that increasing pecan intake for four weeks significantly improved blood antioxidant profiles.</p>
</div>
<h3>16. Pistachios</h3>
<div class="image-content">
 <img src="images/pistachios.jpg" alt="">
 </div>
  <div class="para">
<p>High in a wide array of vitamins and minerals, pistachios are also one of the best nuts for protein. Still, many people wonder: Are pistachios good for you? One ounce of dry-roasted pistachios contains approximately:</p>
<ul>
<li>161 calories</li>
<li>7.8 grams carbohydrates</li>
<li>6 grams protein</li>
<li>13 grams fat</li>
<li>2.9 grams dietary fiber</li>
<li>0.4 miligram copper (19 percent DV)</li>
<li>0.4 miligram manganese (18 percent DV)</li>
<li>0.4 miligram vitamin B6 (18 percent DV)</li>
<li>0.2 miligram thiamine (16 percent DV)</li>
<li>137 miligrams phosphorus (14 percent DV)</li>
</ul>
<p>So are pistachios healthy? A study published in the Journal of the American College of Nutrition found that eating two to three ounces per day of pistachios improved blood lipid levels and lowered the ratio of bad LDL cholesterol to good HDL cholesterol. (34) Another study found that eating pistachios helped maintain normal blood sugar levels after eating a high-carbohydrate meal.</p>

<p>Other research has suggested that pistachios could improve motor function, reduce oxidative stress and inflammation and enhance blood vessel function, ranking them among the healthiest nuts around.</p>
</div>
<h3>Are There Unhealthy Nuts?</h3>
<p>Not all nuts are created equal. While there are plenty of nuts jam-packed with nutrients, some types of processing may diminish the health benefits of nuts.</p>

<p>Pre-shelled nuts, for instance, leave the natural casings of the nut exposed, causing the natural fats and oils to break down and become rancid more easily.</p>

<p>Nuts that are pre-seasoned or flavored can also be high in added sugar or salt, reducing their health properties. Even nuts that are roasted can be unhealthy because they are roasted in harmful hydrogenated vegetable oils and fats.</p>

<p>Nut butters are also not necessarily healthy — though they can be — since many types are chock-full of sugar, salt and hydrogenated oils.</p>

<p>Opt for unsalted, dry-roasted nuts whenever possible, and look for raw and organic nut butters with minimal added ingredients to ensure you’re getting the best quality.</p>

<h4>Precautions</h4>
<p>Many types of nuts are loaded with health benefits, but they’re also loaded with calories as well — and when it comes to nuts, more is not always better. Be sure to moderate your portion sizes and limit it to one ounce at a time to reap the health rewards of nuts without taking a toll on your waistline.</p>

<p>Additionally, nut allergies are common and can be dangerous. A peanut allergy, for instance, can cause skin reactions, digestive problems and even anaphylaxis, which can be life-threatening. Tree nut allergies are also fairly common and can cause an allergic reaction in response to eating other types of nuts, such as almonds, walnuts, cashews and pistachios.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that even the healthiest nuts can become unhealthy when they’re loaded with extra ingredients. Look for unsalted, dry-roasted nuts, and skip the heavily processed and flavored nuts that are high in sugar, salt and hydrogenated oils.</p>

<h4>Warnings</h4>

<p>As nuts and seeds are common food allergens, eat them only if you are certain you are not allergic to them.</p>
<p>Always opt for the recommended daily serving and avoid overeating.</p>
<p>Always store nuts and seeds in airtight containers. This will help prevent the oil in them from going rancid.</p>
<p>Careful handling is important to prevent them from being exposed to harmful bacteria.</p>

<h4>Final Thoughts on Healthiest Nuts</h4>
<p>Nuts provide many important nutrients, and nut consumption has even been associated with health benefits like a reduced risk of cancer and heart disease.</p>
<p>The healthiest nuts include almonds, Brazil nuts, cashews, hazelnuts, macadamia nuts, Valencia peanuts, pecans, walnuts and pistachios.</p>
<p>Nuts that are heavily processed or contain added ingredients can actually be high in added sugars and sodium. Opt for minimally processed nuts without extra ingredients to maximize health benefits.</p>
<p>Additionally, keep intake in moderation, and remember to combine with a balanced diet and healthy lifestyle to see the most results.</p>

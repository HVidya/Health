Risotto has become the hottest item on Italian menus, but this unique recipe is a dessert risotto, replacing the usual stock and wine with milk and fruit juice. If you like rice pudding, you'll love this!

Ingredients:
1/2 cup dried Cranberries</li>
3 1/2 cups fat-free skim or 1% low-fat Milk</li>
1 Cinnamon stick</li>
1 pinch Salt</li>
1 tablespoon Butter </li>
1 large golden delicious Apple, peeled, cored and finely diced (1 1/2 cups)</li>
1/2 cup Arborio Rice</li>
1 1/2 cups apple Cider</li>
2 tablespoons packed light brown Sugar</li>
1 teaspoon Vanilla</li>

Preparation:
1. In a small bowl, cover dried cranberries with boiling water. Set aside for 20 to 30 minutes to plump. 
2. Heat milk, cinnamon stick and salt on the stovetop or in microwave until steaming hot, but not boiling. Remove from the heat, cover and set aside to steep. 
3. In a heavy, deep sauté pan or Dutch oven, heat butter over medium heat. Add apple and cook, stirring frequently, until tender, 1 to 2 minutes. Add rice and cook, stirring constantly, 30 seconds. Add 3/4 cup apple cider and cook, stirring, until most of the liquid has evaporated, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the remaining 3/4 cup of the apple cider and cook, stirring, until most of the liquid has evaporated. Add sugar and mix well. 
4. Add 1/2 cup of the warm milk and the cinnamon stick to the rice mixture and cook, stirring frequently, until almost all of it has been absorbed, 2 to 3 minutes. Continue cooking and stirring, adding remaining milk, 1/2 cup at a time, until the rice is tender and the risotto has a creamy consistency. Total cooking time will be about 20 minutes. 5. Remove from the heat and discard cinnamon stick. 
6. Drain cranberries and stir into risotto, along with vanilla. Let cool for at least 10 minutes before serving warm.

<p>Vegetables are well-known for being good for your health. Most vegetables are low in calories but high in vitamins, minerals and fiber.</p>

<p>However, some vegetables stand out from the rest with additional proven health benefits, such as the ability to fight inflammation or reduce the risk of disease.</p>


<h4>Why are Vegetables Healthy?</h4>
<p>The most nutritious vegetables have a wide variety (and high density) of nutrients important for a balanced diet.</p>

<p>Things like fiber, vitamins, minerals, and other phytochemicals are found in vegetables, often in high amounts. This is important, because deficiencies in these micronutrients can lead to poor health.</p>
<p>This page takes a look at  healthiest vegetables and why you should include them in your diet.</p>
<h4>1. Spinach</h4>
<p>This leafy green tops the chart as one of the healthiest vegetables, thanks to its impressive nutrient profile.</p>

<p>One cup (30 grams) of raw spinach provides 56% of your daily vitamin A needs plus your entire daily vitamin K requirement — all for just 7 calories.</p>

<p>Spinach also boasts a great deal of antioxidants, which can help reduce the risk of chronic disease.</p>

<p>One study found that dark green leafy vegetables like spinach are high in beta-carotene and lutein, two types of antioxidants that have been associated with a decreased risk of cancer.</p>

<p>In addition, a 2015 study found that spinach consumption may be beneficial for heart health, as it may lower blood pressure.</p>

<p><b>SUMMARY:</b>
Spinach is rich in antioxidants that may reduce the risk of chronic disease, as it may reduce risk factors such as high blood pressure.</p>

<h4>2. Carrots</h4>
<p>Carrots are packed with vitamin A, providing 428% of the daily recommended value in just one cup (128 grams).</p>

<p>They contain beta-carotene, an antioxidant that gives carrots their vibrant orange color and could help in cancer prevention.</p>

<p>In fact, one study revealed that for each serving of carrots per week, participants' risk of prostate cancer decreased by 5%.</p>

<p>Another study showed that eating carrots may reduce the risk of lung cancer in smokers as well. Compared to those who ate carrots at least once a week, smokers who did not eat carrots had a three times greater risk of developing lung cancer.</p>

<p>Carrots are also high in vitamin C, vitamin K and potassium.</p>

<p><b>SUMMARY:</b>
Carrots are especially high in beta-carotene, which can turn into vitamin A in the body. Their high antioxidant content may help reduce the risk of lung and prostate cancer.</p>

<h4>3. Tomatoes</h4>


<p>Tomatoes are worth getting excited about because of their strong anti-cancer properties from the lycopene they contain. There’s also some key vitamin support with vitamins like Vitamin K adding to the equation.</p>

<p>This same lycopene also benefits you by providing help for diabetes, heart disease, osteoporosis, and even infertility. It’s also been noted for its ability to fight premature aging of the skin thanks to its antioxidant nature and ability to fight free radical damage.</p>

<p>Lycopene is not all that tomatoes offer, and you’ll be getting sufficient amounts of Vitamin A and Vitamin C, along with some fiber and potassium.</p>

<p>Best ways to prepare it: To release the most lycopene be sure to cook your tomatoes rather than eat them raw. The cooking process drastically increases the amount of lycopene you’ll be able to absorb, thus boosting the amount of benefits you’ll get from eating tomatoes.</p>

<h4>4. Sweet Potatoes</h4>

<p>Sweet potatoes have been recommended by many health experts as a better choice than white potatoes for the antioxidants and fiber they contain.</p>

<p>They have a bright orange color which is a clue that they’re full of beta-Carotene, much like a carrot. This will be converted to Vitamin A by the body, and you don’t have to be concerned that one serving of sweet potato provides far more than the daily recommended supply of Vitamin A. Taking large doses of synthetic forms of Vitamin A poses a health risk, not natural sources like a sweet potato.</p>

<p>Eating a sweet potato is a great way to boost your fiber, as well as your potassium and Vitamin B-6 levels. It’s no slouch in the nutrient department and does make a suitable replacement for potatoes in most recipes.</p>

<p>Best ways to prepare it: A baked sweet potato is one of the easiest side dishes to prepare, and it serves as a satisfying addition to most any protein like chicken, beef, or fish. Or try them mashed as a more nutritious alternative to mashed potatoes.</p>
<h4>5. Cauliflower</h4>

<p>Cauliflower has been surging in popularity in recent years as it’s been shown to be one of the healthier vegetables around, and more versatile than its broccoli and cabbage cousins.</p>

<p>Most will likely be interested in cauliflower for its anti-cancer properties. The sulforaphane is the main reason why it’s so effective. This same compound helps the body in other ways, including maintaining healthy blood pressure levels, which contributes to overall heart health.</p>

<p>Cauliflower is just one of the many cruciferous vegetables on our list, and choosing one of these family member is a good way to make sure that you’re getting real nutrition at your meal.</p>

<p>Best ways to prepare it: The beauty of cauliflower is its versatility. This is a vegetable that can be quite easily turned into rice, or made into a pizza crust as a healthy and grain-free break from tradition.</p>
<h4>6. Celery</h4>

<p>Celery is often referenced as the food you eat when trying to go on a diet or eat right. It’s a good-for-you vegetable that isn’t all that fun to eat, but is worth it for the nutrition it provides.</p>

<p>Reducing excessive inflammation in the body is an important step in achieving the highest levels of health possible. Celery can help you do just that because it’s an alkaline food. It’s also mostly water, so it’s a hydrating vegetable that is akin to drinking more water.</p>

<p>The reason celery is often associated with weight loss is because it’s so low in calories it has almost no effect on your daily calorie intake, is virtually fat free, and is very low in net carbs.</p>

<p>Best ways to prepare it: If the thought of eating celery sticks straight up turns you off, there are plenty of ways to make them more enticing. Try adding them to soups or salads, and as a last resort add them to a green smoothie so you don’t have to chew them up.</p>
<h4>7. Bell Peppers</h4>

<p>No matter which color bell pepper you go with, you’ll be getting a host of benefits that makes it worthwhile. They’ll improve the appearance of any meal, and their bright colors mean there’s antioxidants within them.</p>

<p>The Vitamin C in bell peppers is off the charts. This makes them an important vegetable to help bolster your immune system, which leads to better overall health and fewer instances of illness both in the short term as well as long-term degenerative diseases.</p>

<p>Bell peppers are a low-calorie food, so you can eat them and feel satisfied, but not do much to your total calories for the day. This makes it a great addition to a weight-conscious diet.</p>


<p>Best ways to prepare it: Bell peppers are very versatile and you can use them to dress up a main entree, or grill them up along with onions to add the taste of a fajitas, or you can stuff them in a stuffed peppers recipe for a built-in vegetable serving.</p>

<h4>8. Beets</h4>

<p>Beets are becoming better known for the nutrition they provide, especially since antioxidants have been making so many health news headlines. There’s a powerful antioxidant known as betalains that is almost exclusive to beets.</p>

<p>Betalains are most notable for their ability to curb inflammation in the body, and as such they can help prevent cancer, keep your cardiovascular system functioning properly, and reduce the symptoms of arthritis.</p>

<p>In addition to the betalains beets contain, they are also a wonderful source of fiber, which helps maintain good blood pressure levels, and keeps the digestive system humming along.</p>

<p>Best ways to prepare it: Avoid the pickled beets you’ll find on store shelves and opt instead for fresh beets. Cut them up and place the cubes on a baking dish. Bake them in the oven until they’ve softened and you’re ready for a treat.</p>
<h4>9. Cabbage</h4>

<p>Cabbage is one vegetable that you’ll often see on diet plans for its ability to spur weight loss. But it has plenty of other healthy benefits to it that make it a vegetable you’ll want to add to your cart regularly.</p>

<p>A cruciferous vegetable, cabbage has anti-cancer properties, for men it can help prevent prostate cancer, and for women it has been shown to help ward off breast cancer, making it an especially valuable vegetable for those with a family history of these diseases.</p>

<p>The naturally low number of calories in cabbage, coupled with its low fat content is what makes it such a darling for those looking to get to a healthy weight. It’s a way to get fiber and vitamins without adding much to your total caloric intake for the day.</p>

<p>Best ways to prepare it: Making cabbage appetizing is the key to eating more of it. If you’ve had multiple instances of eating poorly cooked cabbage, you may want to give it another chance in a proper recipe. You want it soft enough to be easily chewed up, but no so soft as to make it mushy and bland. Accompanying spices and seasonings make all the difference.</p>
<h4>10. Broccoli</h4>
<p>Broccoli belongs to the cruciferous family of vegetables.</p>

<p>It is rich in a sulfur-containing plant compound known as glucosinolate, as well as sulforaphane, a by-product of glucosinolate.</p>

<p>Sulforaphane is significant in that it has been shown to have a protective effect against cancer.

<p>In one animal study, sulforaphane was able to reduce the size and number of breast cancer cells while also blocking tumor growth in mice.</p>

<p>Eating broccoli may help prevent other types of chronic disease, too.</p>

<p>A 2010 animal study found that consuming broccoli sprouts could protect the heart from disease-causing oxidative stress by significantly lowering levels of oxidants.</p>

<p>In addition to its ability to prevent disease, broccoli is also loaded with nutrients.</p>

<p>A cup (91 grams) of raw broccoli provides 116% of your daily vitamin K needs, 135% of the daily vitamin C requirement and a good amount of folate, manganese and potassium.</p>

<p>SUMMARY:
Broccoli is a cruciferous vegetable that contains sulforaphane, a compound that may prevent cancer growth. Eating broccoli may also help reduce the risk of chronic disease by protecting against oxidative stress.</p>
<h4>11. Garlic</h4>
<p>Garlic has a long history of use as a medicinal plant, with roots tracing all the way back to ancient China and Egypt.</p>

<p>The main active compound in garlic is allicin, a plant compound that is largely responsible for garlic's variety of health benefits.</p>

<p>Several studies have shown that garlic can regulate blood sugar as well as promote heart health.</p>

<p>In one animal study, diabetic rats were given either garlic oil or diallyl trisulfide, a component of garlic. Both garlic compounds caused a decrease in blood sugar and improved insulin sensitivity.</p>

<p>Another study fed garlic to participants both with and without heart disease. Results showed that garlic was able to decrease total blood cholesterol, triglycerides and LDL cholesterol while increasing HDL cholesterol in both groups.</p>

<p>Garlic may be useful in the prevention of cancer as well. One test-tube study demonstrated that allicin induced cell death in human liver cancer cells.</p>

<p>However, further research is needed to better understand the potential anti-cancer effects of garlic.</p>

<p>SUMMARY:
Studies show that garlic may help lower blood triglyceride levels. Some studies have also found that it could decrease blood sugar levels and may have an anti-cancer effect, although more research is needed.</p>

<h4>12. Brussels Sprouts</h4>
<p>Like broccoli, Brussels sprouts are a member of the cruciferous family of vegetables and contain the same health-promoting plant compounds.</p>

<p>Brussels sprouts also contain kaempferol, an antioxidant that may be particularly effective in preventing damage to cells.</p>

<p>One animal study found that kaempferol protected against free radicals, which cause oxidative damage to cells and can contribute to chronic disease.</p>

<p>Brussels sprout consumption can help enhance detoxification as well.

<p>One study showed that eating Brussels sprouts led to a 15–30% increase in some of the specific enzymes that control detoxification, which could decrease the risk of colorectal cancer.</p>

<p>Additionally, Brussels sprouts are very nutrient-dense. Each serving provides a good amount of many vitamins and minerals, including vitamin K, vitamin A, vitamin C, folate, manganese and potassium.</p>

<p>SUMMARY:
Brussels sprouts contain an antioxidant called kaempferol, which may protect against oxidative damage to cells and prevent chronic disease. They may also help enhance detoxification in the body.</p>

<h4>13. Kale</h4>
<p>Like other leafy greens, kale is well-known for its health-promoting qualities, including its nutrient density and antioxidant content.</p>

<p>A cup (67 grams) of raw kale contains plenty of B vitamins, potassium, calcium and copper.</p>

<p>It also fulfills your entire daily requirement for vitamins A, C and K .</p>

<p>Due to its high amount of antioxidants, kale may also be beneficial in promoting heart health.</p>

<p>In a 2008 study, 32 men with high cholesterol drank 150 ml of kale juice daily for 12 weeks. By the end of the study, HDL cholesterol increased by 27%, LDL cholesterol decreased by 10% and antioxidant activity was increased.</p>

<p>Another study showed that drinking kale juice can decrease blood pressure and may be beneficial in reducing both blood cholesterol and blood sugar.</p>

<p>SUMMARY:
Kale is high in vitamins A, C and K as well as antioxidants. Studies show that drinking kale juice could reduce blood pressure and LDL cholesterol while increasing HDL cholesterol.</p>
<h4>14. Green Peas</h4>
<p>Peas are considered a starchy vegetable. This means they have a higher amount of carbs and calories than non-starchy vegetables and may impact blood sugar levels when eaten in large amounts.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, green peas are incredibly nutritious.</p>

<p>One cup (160 grams) of cooked green peas contains 9 grams of fiber, 9 grams of protein and vitamins A, C and K, riboflavin, thiamin, niacin and folate.</p>

<p>Because they are high in fiber, peas support digestive health by enhancing the beneficial bacteria in your gut and promoting regular bowel movements.</p>

<p>Moreover, peas are rich in saponins, a group of plant compounds known for their anti-cancer effects.</p>

<p>Research shows that saponins may help fight cancer by reducing tumor growth and inducing cell death in cancer cells.</p>

<p>SUMMARY:
Green peas contain a good amount of fiber, which helps support digestive health. They also contain plant compounds called saponins, which may have anti-cancer effects.</p>
<h4>15. Swiss Chard</h4>
<p>Swiss chard is low in calories but high in many essential vitamins and minerals.</p>

<p>One cup (36 grams) contains just 7 calories yet 1 gram of fiber, 1 gram of protein and lots of vitamins A, C and K, manganese and magnesium.</p>

<p>Swiss chard is especially known for its potential to prevent damage caused by diabetes mellitus.</p>

<p>In one animal study, chard extract was found to reverse the effects of diabetes by decreasing blood sugar levels and preventing cell damage from disease-causing free radicals.</p>

<p>Other animal studies have shown that the antioxidant content of chard extract can protect the liver and kidneys from the negative effects of diabetes.</p>

<p>SUMMARY:
Some animal studies show that Swiss chard could protect against the negative effects of diabetes and may decrease blood sugar levels.</p>
<h4>16. Ginger</h4>
<p>Ginger root is used as a spice in everything from vegetable dishes to desserts.</p>

<p>Historically, ginger has also been used as a natural remedy for motion sickness.</p>

<p>Several studies have confirmed the beneficial effects of ginger on nausea. In a review comprised of 12 studies and nearly 1,300 pregnant women, ginger significantly reduced nausea compared to a placebo.</p>

<p>Ginger also contains potent anti-inflammatory properties, which can be helpful in treating inflammation-related disorders like arthritis, lupus or gout.</p>

<p>In one study, participants with osteoarthritis who were treated with a concentrated ginger extract experienced reduced knee pain and relief from other symptoms.</p>

<p>Further research suggests that ginger could aid in the treatment of diabetes as well.

<p>A 2015 study looked at the effects of ginger supplements on diabetes. After 12 weeks, ginger was found to be effective in decreasing blood sugar levels.</p>

<p>SUMMARY:
Studies show that ginger could reduce nausea and alleviate inflammation. Ginger supplements may also help decrease blood sugar.</p>
<h4>17. Asparagus</h4>
<p>This spring vegetable is rich in several vitamins and minerals, making it an excellent addition to any diet.</p>

<p>Just half a cup (90 grams) of asparagus provides one-third of your daily folate needs.</p>

<p>This amount also provides plenty of selenium, vitamin K, thiamin and riboflavin.</p>

<p>Getting enough folate from sources like asparagus can offer protection from disease and can prevent neural tube birth defects during pregnancy.</p>

<p>Some test-tube studies also show that asparagus may benefit the liver by supporting its metabolic function and protecting it against toxicity.</p>

<p>SUMMARY:
Asparagus is especially high in folate, which may help prevent neural tube birth defects. Test-tube studies have also found that asparagus can support liver function and reduce the risk of toxicity.</p>
<h4>18. Red Cabbage</h4>
<p>This vegetable belongs to the cruciferous family of vegetables and, much like its relatives, is brimming with antioxidants and health-promoting properties.</p>

<p>One cup (89 grams) of raw red cabbage contains 2 grams of fiber as well as 85% of the daily vitamin C requirement.</p>

<p>Red cabbage is also rich in anthocyanins, a group of plant compounds that contribute to its distinct color as well as a whole host of health benefits.</p>

<p>In a 2012 animal study, rats were fed a diet designed to increase cholesterol levels and increase plaque buildup in the arteries. The rats were then given red cabbage extract.</p>

<p>The study found that red cabbage extract was able to prevent increases in blood cholesterol levels and protect against damage to the heart and liver.</p>

<p>These results were supported by another animal study in 2014 showing that red cabbage could reduce inflammation and prevent liver damage in rats fed a high-cholesterol diet.</p>

<p>SUMMARY:
Red cabbage contains a good amount of fiber, vitamin C and anthocyanins. Certain studies show that it may decrease blood cholesterol levels, reduce inflammation and lower the risk of heart and liver damage.</p>
<h4>19. Sweet Potatoes</h4>
<p>Classified as a root vegetable, sweet potatoes stand out for their vibrant orange color, sweet taste and impressive health benefits.</p>

<p>One medium sweet potato contains 4 grams of fiber, 2 grams of protein and a good amount of vitamin C, vitamin B6, potassium and manganese.</p>

<p>It's also high in a form of vitamin A called beta-carotene. In fact, one sweet potato fulfills 438% of your daily vitamin A needs.</p>

<p>Beta-carotene consumption has been linked to a significant decrease in the risk of certain types of cancer, including lung and breast cancer.</p>

<p>Specific types of sweet potatoes may also contain additional benefits. For example, Caiapo is a type of white sweet potato that may have an anti-diabetic effect.</p>

<p>In one study, people with diabetes were given 4 grams of Caiapo daily over 12 weeks, leading to a reduction in both blood sugar and blood cholesterol levels.</p>

<p>SUMMARY:
Sweet potatoes are high in beta-carotene, which may decrease the risk of some types of cancer. White sweet potatoes could also help reduce blood cholesterol and blood sugar levels.</p>
<h4>20. Collard Greens</h4>
<p>Collard greens are a very nutrient-rich vegetable.</p>

<p>One cup (190 grams) of cooked collard greens contains 5 grams of fiber, 4 grams of protein and 27% of your daily calcium needs.</p>

<p>In fact, collard greens are one of the best plant sources of calcium available, along with other leafy greens, broccoli and soybeans.</p>

<p>Adequate calcium intake from plant sources can promote bone health and has been shown to decrease the risk of osteoporosis.</p>

<p>Collard greens are also high in antioxidants and could even reduce your risk of developing certain diseases.</p>

<p>One study found that eating more than one serving of collard greens per week was associated with a 57% decreased risk of glaucoma, an eye condition that can lead to blindness.</p>

<p>Another study showed that a high intake of vegetables in the Brassica family, which includes collard greens, may decrease the risk of prostate cancer.</p>

<p>SUMMARY:
Collard greens are high in calcium, which could reduce the risk of osteoporosis. The regular intake of collard greens has also been associated with a reduced risk of glaucoma and prostate cancer.</p>

<h4>21. Kohlrabi</h4>
<p>Also known as the turnip cabbage or German turnip, kohlrabi is a vegetable related to the cabbage that can be eaten raw or cooked.</p>

<p>Raw kohlrabi is high in fiber, providing 5 grams in each cup (135 grams). It's also full of vitamin C, providing 140% of the daily value per cup.</p>

<p>Studies have shown that the antioxidant content of kohlrabi makes it a powerful tool against inflammation and diabetes.</p>

<p>In one animal study, kohlrabi extract was able to decrease blood sugar levels by 64% within just seven days of treatment.</p>

<p>Though there are different types of kohlrabi available, studies show that red kohlrabi has nearly twice the amount of phenolic antioxidants and displays stronger anti-diabetic and anti-inflammatory effects.</p>

<p>SUMMARY:
Kohlrabi is rich in both fiber and vitamin C. Animal studies show that kohlrabi could potentially cause a reduction in blood sugar.</p>

<h4>The Bottom Line</h4>
<p>From providing essential vitamins and minerals to fighting disease, it's clear that including vegetables in your diet is crucial for good health.</p>

<p>While the vegetables listed here have been extensively studied for their health benefits, there are plenty more vegetables that are also excellent for your health.</p>

<p>Ensure that you're getting a good mix of vegetables in your diet to take advantage of their many diverse health benefits and get the most nutritional bang for your buck.</p>
